The **Task Management System** is a robust, user-friendly backend application designed to help individuals and teams efficiently manage their tasks.
The application allows authenticated users to create, update, view, and delete tasks, offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
It provides an intuitive interface for organizing tasks and tracking progress, helping users stay productive and on top of their work.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system to ensure that only authorized users can access their task lists.

- **Task Management**: Update task details, mark tasks as completed, or delete them when no longer needed.
- **Task Categorization**: Organize tasks by labels or categories for better organization and filtering.
- **Task History**: Track and review past tasks and their progress over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: .NET Core 8
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Encryption**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Design Pattern**: Repository Pattern
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI (if used for API documentation)

## Project Benefits
- **Security**: With JWT authentication and AES encryption, this system ensures that user data and task information remain secure and protected.
- **Scalability**: Built on .NET Core and PostgreSQL, the system is designed to scale with increasing users and tasks.
- **Maintainability**: The use of clean code practices like the Repository Pattern ensures that the system is easy to maintain, extend, and test.

This Task Management System backend is ideal for developers looking to implement secure task tracking solutions,
while leveraging modern development practices and tools to build a reliable and high-performance system.
